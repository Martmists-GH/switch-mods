This repository holds all the mods I'm currently actively developing. Some of my older mods might not be present due to the switch to hakkun.

- Python 3.12+
- The clang compiler
- Cmake
- CLion is recommended but not strictly necessary

#### Optional: Setting up CLion

1. Open the project
2. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake`
3. Add `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain.cmake` to the CMake options field. Optionally add `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON`
4. Reload the CMake project

### Building the mods

#### Using CLion

1. Select the target in the top-right dropdown
2. Click the 'Build Project' button next to it (the hammer icon)

#### Using the command line

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build --toolchain=cmake/toolchain.cmake
$ cmake --build build
```
